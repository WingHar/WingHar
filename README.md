- 👋 Hi, I’m @WingHar
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, gaming, reading, and sci-fi + fantasy movies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the react.js Javascript framework and Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a few projects of mine such as a Science-Fiction based NETFLIX which parses and grabs videos from YouTube using the YouTube tags and API.
